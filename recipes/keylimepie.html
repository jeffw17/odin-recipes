            <p>
                This pie is always well received whenever served - it is light and refreshing and very attractive, too. An all-time favorite! 
                You may substitute the key lime juice with a mixture of 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and 1/4 cup fresh lime juice.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs with sugar and melted butter. 
                    Press into 9 inch pie plate and bake for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separate 2 of the eggs, placing the two egg whites into a mixing bowl. 
                    Reserve the yolks in another bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To the yolks, add one whole egg, lime juice and sweetened condensed milk. Whisk until smooth. With clean mixer blades or a whisk attachment, 
                    beat the egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until stiff, but not dry. Fold whites into filling mixture. 
                    Pour filling into partially baked crust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes or until set. Let cool at room temperature, 
                    then freeze 4 hours to overnight. Just before serving, whip cream to form stiff peaks. 
                    Serve decorated with whipped cream and lime slices.
